# Exercise create-react-app

Create a new web application using `create-react-app`

```bash
> npx create-react-app login-ex --template=typescript
```

You will need to create the login page you created in the first lesson.  
4 components:
- App
  - Header
  - Login
  - Footer
  
Use `Material Design` to help you design your app.

[Material Design](https://mui.com/)

You can use the following components from `Material Design`.

## Login

- Use the [card](https://mui.com/components/cards/#main-content) component to place the `form` in a card
- Use the [TextField](https://mui.com/components/text-fields/#heading-basic-textfield) for the form inputs
- use the [Button](https://mui.com/components/buttons/#main-content) for the form submit button.

## Header

- use the [AppBar](https://mui.com/components/app-bar/#main-content)
- your header will have a logo image and a title

## App

- use the [Grid](https://mui.com/components/grid/#main-content) to make the login responsive.  

Responsive means it will grab part of the screen on medium screens, smaller part on larger screens, and the entire width on small screens.

## SCSS

- You can try and design your app using `SCSS`
- you can try to use scss modules
